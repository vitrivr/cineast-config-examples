# Cineast Config Examples
Examples of Cineast configuration and extraction job files. A detailed description of Cineast extraction configuration
files is available on the [Cineast wiki](https://github.com/vitrivr/cineast/wiki).

The examples include:
- [A basic image and video extraction job configuration](jobs/image-video-job.json)
- [A multimedia extraction job configuration](jobs/multimedia-job.json) (If 3D rendering causes problems, the
Model3DThumbnailExporter should be removed, but 3D model thumbnails will no longer be created)
- [A basic image and video extraction job configuration for extracting features into JSON format](jobs/json-job.json)
- [A basic image sequence extraction job configuration](jobs/image-sequence-job.json)
